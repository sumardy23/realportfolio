      <p class="pfont">My name is Latisha Sumardy, and I am a student at Dublin High School, currently located in Dublin, California. On the weekends, I enjoy playing badminton, drawing, and making origami. I also coach an Odysssey of the Mind Team in my spare time. </p>

      <h4>07/07/2017</h4>
      <p class="pfont">Some similarities are that Python and Scratch both have similar loops that you can use, and many of the features of Python and Scratch are the same, like the variables and what not. Some differences that I found were that Python was very specific about the ordering of the code, unlike Scratch, which was more lenient. Another difference was that the conditions of some of the loops and conditionals worked differently from language to language, and the different languages required different things.
</p>
      <p class="pfont">For me, it felt like debugging took more time than actually writing the programme. Sometimes, it was kind of frustrating because once you thought that you fixed one part of the code, another problem would pop up just because of that one fix that you just made. Also, sometimes it was hard to find which part of the programme was causing the bug, as sometimes the errors were a result of an ordering mistake, which requires a lot of trial and error to fix.

      <h4>07/10/2017</h4>
      <p class="pfont">My idea of robotics changed because I realized that robotics had a much larger range than just making robots that moved, it actually included things a majority of things that were programmable and were able to follow a set of instructions that it was given. Something that made me excited about the future of robotics is that we will one day be able to get places without driving ourselves, and it will eventually make our lives much easier and much less stressful. Something that makes me nervous about the future of robotics is that it will eventually change the way that wars are being fought, and we may not be prepared for when that happens.
</p>
    <p class="pfont">Something that worked well when we were grouped up was that there were more people to talk to about new ideas, and it took less time to put an idea into action, as one part of the group could work on new ways to solve a problem, and the other part could actually test the ideas to see if they actually worked. Something that we could do better next time is think of more ideas individually, as it seemed like many times we just went off one person's ideas.</p>
      <h4>07/13/2017</h4>
      <p>I learned how to make the robot move around based on commands that we programmed into it, and we also were able to make the robot sing using circuits we made, which was really cool. My favourite part of the robot's dance was the way that it was able to sing a specific song that we programmed into it. The kinds of outputs that Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need for their robots are movement and sensory, to sense their surroundings.</p>

    <p class = "pfont">This is the first ciruit that we tried to make. We had to make an LED light up on the breadboard. The most important things that we learned were that the circuit is connected by row, not by column, and the jump wires were required if one wanted to connect different columns and rows together. Also, the resistor was needed in order to make sure that the LED lights would not burn out.</p>

      <p class = "pfont">This is our light show project. We learned how to wire multiple LED lights so that they would light up at certain times. We also learned how to use C++ to program the robot, as well as how to use a for-loop and if-else statements.</p>

    <div class= "bottom">
      <p class = "pfont"> Manuela Veloso's work is similar to Ayanna Howard's because they both work with computers to try and help people and society. Our team worked together on the lightshow by splitting the team up, so that two people would work on the circuit, one person would write the code, and another person would check the code for errors or typos. Our team could have improved by coming up with a few more creative ideas on what to do with the color patterns. The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch are comments, variables, functions, pinMode(), digitalWrite(), delay(), setup() and loop().</p>
